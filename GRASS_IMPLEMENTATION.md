# Grass Implementation Documentation

This document explains how the grass system has been implemented in this Three.js project.

## Implementation Checklist

### ✅ Setup and Prerequisites
- ✅ Proper loading of shaders using fetch

### ✅ Terrain Setup
- ✅ Generated procedural terrain using heightmap
- ✅ Created heightmap generator
- ✅ Set up terrain dimensions, height, and offset parameters

### ✅ Grass Component
- ✅ Created `GrassComponent` class
- ✅ Initialized with parameters:
  - ✅ Scene reference
  - ✅ Heightmap texture
  - ✅ Dimensions
  - ✅ Height and offset values

### ✅ Grass Geometry
- ✅ Created low detail geometry for distant grass (1 segment)
- ✅ Created high detail geometry for nearby grass (6 segments)
- ✅ Set up instanced buffer geometry for efficient rendering
- ✅ Defined grass patch size (10 units) and distribution
- ✅ Configured grass dimensions (width: 0.1, height: 1.5)

### ✅ Grass Shaders
- ✅ Created vertex shader:
  - ✅ Position grass blades based on terrain height
  - ✅ Wind animation
  - ✅ Player interaction (bending away from player)
  - ✅ LOD transitions
  - ✅ Random variations (height, width, color)
- ✅ Created fragment shader:
  - ✅ Lighting and coloring
  - ✅ Transparency
  - ✅ LOD color transitions

### ✅ Rendering Optimization
- ✅ Implemented frustum culling
- ✅ Only render grass patches near the camera
- ✅ Set up LOD distance parameters
- ✅ Used instanced rendering for performance

### ✅ Animation and Interactivity
- ✅ Implemented time-based animation
- ✅ Created wind effect using noise
- ✅ Made grass react to player position
- ✅ Real-time animation updates

### ✅ Integration
- ✅ Initialized grass in the main scene
- ✅ Connected to terrain height
- ✅ Handled camera movement for LOD

## How to Use

To use the grass system in another project:

1. Copy these files:
   - `public/assets/shaders/grass.vert`
   - `public/assets/shaders/grass.frag`
   - `src/components/GrassComponent.js`
   - `src/_lib/heightmapGenerator.js` (if you need procedural terrain)

2. Initialize the grass system:

```javascript
// Generate or load a heightmap first
const heightmap = generateHeightmap(256, 0.02, 1.2, 4);

// Create the grass system
const grassSystem = new GrassComponent({
  scene: yourScene,                   // Three.js scene
  heightmap: heightmap,               // Heightmap texture
  terrainSize: 100,                   // Width/depth of terrain
  maxHeight: 5,                       // Maximum terrain height
  minHeight: 0,                       // Minimum terrain height
  heightOffset: 0,                    // Height offset
  patchSize: 10,                      // Size of each grass patch
  density: 3,                         // Blades per square unit
  playerObject: yourPlayerObject      // Player for interaction
});
```

3. Update the grass system in your animation loop:

```javascript
function animate() {
  const delta = clock.getDelta();
  
  // Update your scene, camera, etc.
  
  // Update grass system
  grassSystem.update(delta);
  
  renderer.render(scene, camera);
}
```

## Performance Considerations

- Grass is rendered in patches around the player
- Only patches within visibility distance are rendered
- LOD system reduces detail for distant grass
- Using instanced rendering significantly improves performance
- Adjust `density` and `patchSize` parameters for performance tuning

## Customization

You can customize the grass appearance by modifying:

- Shader parameters in `GrassComponent.js`
- Color values in the grass creation function
- Wind parameters in the vertex shader
- LOD distance settings
